In this program, I used several tools from the **scikit-learn** library along with **pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to build a spam email detection model. The main steps involved loading and exploring the dataset using pandas, converting text messages into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorization**, and training a **Naive Bayes classifier** from scikit-learn to predict whether an email is spam or not. I evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report. From this project, I learned how to preprocess text data, apply machine learning algorithms for classification tasks, and assess a model's effectiveness using key evaluation metrics. It also demonstrated the importance of data cleaning and feature extraction when working with natural language data.
